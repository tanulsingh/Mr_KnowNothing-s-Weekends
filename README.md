Optimizing MLLoss by publishing one article at a time ;-)

# About this Series

Hi Everyone , I am Mr_KnowNothing you might know me from Kaggle or LinkedIn and if not this section will definitely help . I am a Mechanical Engineering graduate turned data scientist.
Yeah you heard right.... Are we even allowed to do that you ask? Yes my friend we are . In this digital era a human is limited by his/her own imaginations and anyone can do anything

In January 2020 All I knew was how to do EDA with Tabular data and would struggle to write even short pieces of code in python , and one year later I have six Kaggle competition Medals
I know what's it like to be on the other side as I am still learning everyday .With this series I want to inspire and help people of the community .
Cater and reach larger audience and make this a medium to solve a vast amount of similar queries

While other blogs and great writers in the community tell what and how of things , I want to answer and discuss the whys of things in Machine Learning. 

I plan to publish my articles through Kaggle , Medium and Hackernoon .
